# ASP.NET Razor (cshtml) language support in Atom

Adds syntax highlighting and snippets to ASP.NET Razor (cshtml) files in Atom.

Originally converted from the [Razor SublimeText syntax](https://github.com/joseph-turner/Razor).

Assumes that the html (text.html.basic) and C# (source.cs) language files are already installed.

Contributions are greatly appreciated. Please fork this repository and open a pull request to add snippets, make grammar tweaks, etc.
